    <description><![CDATA[Conquest of Camelot Given filecamelotDescriptionUnlock the secrets and unearth Camelot&rsquo;s grail hidden within.
Author: sahuang
Basic analysis We are given a 64-bit ELF binary, and according to the challenge page, it&rsquo;s written in OCaml. Throwing the binary to IDA and searching for the prompted string, we can locate the main logic of the program at camlDune__exe__Camelot__entry.
I&rsquo;ve never worked with (or heard about) Ocaml before, so the binary threw me off a little bit.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[So because of my laziness, this blog has beed collecting dust for almost a year now. And since I&rsquo;m solving some Flareon challenges from the last years, I figure it would be a good time to post some write up. But I&rsquo;m too lazy to write a proper writeup (and also there are so many writeups of those challs already), I&rsquo;m just gonna post a log of the things I did solving the challenge so that I can look back at it later when I need to.]]></description>
