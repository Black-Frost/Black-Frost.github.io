    <description><![CDATA[So because of my laziness, this blog has beed collecting dust for almost a year now. And since I&rsquo;m solving some Flareon challenges from the last years, I figure it would be a good time to post some write up. But I&rsquo;m too lazy to write a proper writeup (and also there are so many writeups of those challs already), I&rsquo;m just gonna post a log of the things I did solving the challenge so that I can look back at it later when I need to.]]></description>
