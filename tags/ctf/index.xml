Basic analysis We are given a 64-bit ELF binary, and according to the challenge page, it&amp;rsquo;s written in OCaml. Throwing the binary to IDA and searching for the prompted string, we can locate the main logic of the program at camlDune__exe__Camelot__entry.
I&amp;rsquo;ve never worked with (or heard about) Ocaml before, so the binary threw me off a little bit.</description></item><item><title>[TSJ CTF 2022] javascript_vm, w4nn4cryp7 writeup</title><link>/posts/tsjctf2022/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2022 16:43:50 +0700</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>/posts/tsjctf2022/</guid><description>This is another CTF that I get to play with the people at team Project Sekai.

And since I&amp;rsquo;m solving some Flareon challenges from the last years, I figure it would be a good time to post some write up. But I&amp;rsquo;m too lazy to write a proper writeup (and also there are so many writeups of those challs already), I&amp;rsquo;m just gonna post a log of the things I did solving the challenge so that I can look back at it later when I need to.</description></item></channel></rss>
